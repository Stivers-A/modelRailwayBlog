          This website is a project being worked on in parallel to my model
          train layout. I designed it with the end goal of showing my model
          railway and having a show case of my knowledge about React and
          Firebase. Thus this website is part passion project and part portfolio
          piece.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          With that said this site also is a product of passion in its own right, existing so I can share what I have made with others. So I hope you enjoy your time here, and enjoy the scaled views I hope to emulate.
