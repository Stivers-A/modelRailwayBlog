              Hello!
              <br></br>
              Welcome to my model railway, where we journey back to the
              sun-soaked landscapes of 1950s Southern California. In this blog,
              we dive into the world of N scale model trains,and the process of
              making a model railway recreating the vibrant railroads of
              mid-century California. The posts document my journey as I make my
              first model railway.

              The 1950s was a transformative decade for
              railroads, as steam engines gave way to sleek diesel locomotives,
              and Californiaâ€™s rapid growth created a rich tapestry of urban and
              rural settings for rail lines to traverse. While my layout rests
              on a two by four board, my goal for it is to have it represent a
              slice of that tapestry in my home.
